Canonical is building a new generation of Ubuntu-based Docker images to simplify open source application deployment across the world. These container images will be free to use with long term security commitments, and engineered for performance, security and usability. As with Ubuntu, we will work in the open and welcome community participation.

This role is to lead the team to design and build images, tools, technology, and community processes. This is an exciting opportunity for a software engineering manager, or exceptional engineer looking to take on management responsibilities, who is passionate about open source quality, community, containers, devops and cloud.

Come build a rewarding, meaningful career working with the best and brightest people in technology at Canonical. To lead this team successfully you will need to manage high quality open source engineering, demonstrate deep insights into container-based devops, and engage openly with our community. Your time will be split between people management, daily development activities, and direct partner engagement.

As an engineering manager at Canonical your primary responsibility is to your team: ensuring that they grow as engineers, do valuable work, and find satisfaction in their career at Canonical.
